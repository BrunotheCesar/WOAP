Wellington On a Plate is New Zealand's biggest culinary festival held in the Greater Wellington region in which restaurants and food venues showcase what they have best to offer. 
This project is an exploratory data analysis that can provide insights into the 2020's edition in terms of mean, min, and max burger price, as well as the values referring to the beer and burger pairing.

Credits to @steffenrusten for creating the excel spreadsheet used for this project of mine.
